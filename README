The following algorithms have been included :

1)	Primal Simplex
2)	Big M Method Simplex
3)	Two Phase Method Simplex
4)	Dual Simplex
5)	Generalized Simplex
6)	Floyd Warshall Algorithm
7)	Kruskal's Algorithm
8)	Print a Complete Graph
9)	Print a graph from a given Adjacency Matrix
10)	Fractional Knapsack Algorithm
11)	Task Scheduling Algorithm
